--To provide the following information I am working with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store 
--and includes multiple tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, customers, etc.

--1. What was the total revenue of the company in the United States? 

SELECT SUM(UnitPrice*quantity) FROM chinook.invoice_items
INNER JOIN chinook.invoices
ON invoices.invoiceid = invoice_items.invoiceid
WHERE invoices.billingcountry = "USA";

--2. Outside the United States?

SELECT SUM(UnitPrice*quantity) FROM chinook.invoice_items
INNER JOIN chinook.invoices
ON invoices.invoiceid = invoice_items.invoiceid
WHERE invoices.billingcountry <> "USA"

--3. Present a list of all customers in the United States (Group by state of listed billing address).

SELECT i.customerid, c.Lastname, c.Firstname, i.Billingstate as "state" FROM chinook.customers c
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.customerid=i.customerid 
WHERE i.billingcountry = "USA"
GROUP BY i.Billingstate;

--4. Present Customers who are not in the US (Group by country of their listed billing address).

SELECT i.customerid, c.Lastname, c.Firstname, i.BillingCountry FROM chinook.customers c
JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON c.customerid=i.customerid 
WHERE i.billingcountry <> "USA"
GROUP BY i.Billingcountry;

--5. Show all the countries and how many tracks were purchased in each this year.

SELECT i.billingcountry, SUM(ii.quantity) FROM invoices i
JOIN invoice_items ii
ON i.invoiceid = ii.invoiceid
GROUP BY i.billingcountry
ORDER BY SUM(ii.quantity) DESC;

--6. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT t.name, ii.invoicelineid FROM tracks t
JOIN invoice_items ii
ON t.trackid = ii.TrackId
JOIN invoices i
ON i.invoiceid=ii.invoiceid;


--7. Present all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT t.name AS "Track" ,a.title AS "Album" ,m.name AS "Media Type",g.name AS "Genre" FROM tracks t
JOIN albums a
ON a.albumid=t.albumid
JOIN genres g
ON g.genreid=t.GenreId
JOIN media_types m
ON m.mediatypeid = t.mediatypeid;


--8. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT EmployeeId, Lastname, Firstname, Title FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title LIKE "%SALES%";


--9. Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.Lastname, e.Firstname, COUNT(c.customerid) FROM employees e
JOIN customers c
ON c.supportrepid=e.EmployeeId
GROUP BY e.employeeID

--10. Who was the top selling Sales Agent this year?

SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.Lastname, e.Firstname, SUM(i.total) FROM employees e
JOIN customers c
ON c.supportrepid=e.EmployeeId
JOIN invoices i
ON i.customerid=c.CustomerId
